# MineJS
MineJS is an old project of mine that I have given up on. It is a minecraft server coded in javascript. Look below for what you can do on it.

## Current Features
Currently you can only join and chat with other players.

## Why I gave up on it
I gave up on this project when I noticed it would be complicated to make a world system. I wanted it to be able to have it's world system read worlds generated by traditional Bukkit servers and Bukkit forks.

## Setup
To setup the server and run it just make sure you have node installed. The server was developed and tested on v14.16.1. Once you have node installed just run the start.sh.
